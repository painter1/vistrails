Description: VisTrails is a scientific workflow management system.
 VisTrails is a new scientific workflow management system developed at
 the University of Utah that provides support for data exploration and
 visualization. Whereas workflows have been traditionally used to
 automate repetitive tasks, for applications that are exploratory in
 nature, very little is repeated---change is the norm. As an engineer
 or scientist generates and evaluates hypotheses about data under
 study, a series of different, albeit related, workflows are created
 while a workflow is adjusted in an interactive process. VisTrails was
 designed to manage these rapidly-evolving workflows. VisTrails
 streamlines the creation, execution and sharing of complex
 visualizations, data mining or other large-scale data analysis
 applications. By automatically managing the data, metadata, and the
 data exploration process, VisTrails allows users to focus on the task
 at hand and relieves them from tedious and time-consuming tasks
 involved in organizing the vast volumes of data they
 manipulate. VisTrails provides infrastructure that can be combined
 with and enhance existing visualization and workflow systems.
